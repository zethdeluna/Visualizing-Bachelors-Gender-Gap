# Visualizing-Bachelors-Gender-Gap
In this project, I made a visualization displaying the change in gender gap within certain majors, with data collected yearly from 1970 - 2018. "Bachelors Degree Female Percentage.ipynb" shows my process for cleaning and compiling several datasets. "Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees.ipynb" shows my process for visualizing the change in gender gaps.

Modules Used: Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot
